# Mobile Price Classification
## Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of classifying mobile phones into different price ranges, assisting in determining the appropriate price range for mobile phones produced by a company. By analyzing various features of mobile phones, such as RAM, internal memory, and more, we aim to uncover the relationship between these features and the mobile phones' selling prices. This classification approach helps in understanding the relative costliness of each phone without focusing on predicting the exact selling price.

## Key Features
- Data Analysis: Exploration and analysis of mobile phone sales data to identify key features that influence price ranges.
- Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with engineered features that improve the predictive capabilities of the models.
- Classification Models: Application of various classification algorithms to accurately classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their features.
- Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of each model's performance to select the most effective classifier for price range prediction.
